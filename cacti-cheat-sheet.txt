To create devices:
1. On web UI, go to Management -> Devices -> Add
2. Give the form a description and hostname (or IP address).
3. Select a template.
4. Configure SNMP, if applicable.
5. Add a graph template for the device, if applicable.
6. Hit save.

To add graphs:
1. Go to the graphs tab, and hit new graphs under Create.
2. Check one of the existing graph templates, or create one using the drop-down menu.
3. Graphs trees, hierarchical ways of viewing graphs, can be configured in Management -> Graph Trees.
4. 

To monitor SNMP:
1. In device creation, SNMP options can be configured 
2. Only external or spine SNMP should be used, unless Cacti 1 is present.
3. The command snmpwalk can be used in bash to troubleshoot issues with SNMP, if any are advertised.
4. SNMP can be used as a data query, and probably also in graphs.
